# Core Team

Swordfish is built and maintained by volunteers with a desire to increase security amongst teams without adding unnecessary overhead for individuals.

## Areas of Need

There are several areas of expertise needed to make Swordfish successful.

* **JavaScript** - Most of the front application is written in JavaScript, built around [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) and using many libraries.
* **Ruby** - The API is a relatively small Ruby on Rails application, tested with RSpec and Cucumber, with data persisted in MongoDB.
* **Design** - Good visual design is essential to the success of an application.
* **Cryptography** - it's hard, and it's easy to do it wrong.
* **Security** - Any system is only as strong as its weakest point. Strong cryptography is useless if there are simple exploits in other parts of the application.
